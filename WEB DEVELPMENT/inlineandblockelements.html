    <!-- here for making an understanding b/w the block and inline elemts we use a a css style tag  -->

    <!-- now here as we have written the two paragraphs in the same line but they are seprated from each other it is because that the paragraphs are the block elements they occupy a complete block while there is an another case of the inline elements and we can cover them into the inline elements 
    by writing a tag called span which is an inline tag     -->
    
    <p style="border: 2px solid red ;">This is a paragraph</p><p  style="border: 2px solid blue ;">This is also a paragraph</p><br>
    
    <!-- IF WE USE THE STRONG AND ANCHOR TAG ISTEAD OF THE P TAG LETS SEE IT 
    IS BLOCK OR INLINE  -->
    
    <strong style="border: 2px solid red ;">This is a paragraph</strong><a  style="border: 2px solid blue ;">This is also a paragraph</a>
    
    <span style="border: 2px solid red ;">this is a span paragraph</span><span style="border: 2px solid blue ;"> this is also a span paragraph</span>
