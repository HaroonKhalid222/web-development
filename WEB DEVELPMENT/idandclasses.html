    <h3>ids and classes</h3>
    <!--  now suppose i take an div in which i write the id and class of any element suppose for my name then that name if used in one id int the div tag then we can use it in te whole process gain it means that one id when initialized can be used with the same element name again  - -->

    <!-- but in the scene of classes it is not the same i can give many elements to the class for example we can give a redbg class to it and same as that we cann give blackvorder class -->
    <div id="haroon" class="redBg blackBorder">
        this is haroon!
    </div>

    <span class="redBg">
        <!-- see here i have give the class below as i used above and this is not problem but if i use the id i initialized abovedown then there will be a prob  -->
    </span>
    <!-- here is a shortcut lyk we can just say it a short if i need a class of any element then i will use dot(.) but in case of id i will use pound (#) -->
    <!-- this all we can say is emmet (emmet is actually a fast way of writing the HTML) -->

    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <span id="haroon222"></span>

    <div class="redBg blackBorder newclass anotherClass"></div>
    <!-- emmet takes div tag as default  -->
    <!-- .blackBackground -->
    <div class="blackBackground"></div>

    <!-- now here is another emmet for span and div -->
    .blackborder*4
    <div class="blackborder"></div>

    <!-- so basically these will be use with the css for the styling and extra works as we have defined them earlier and can use them gain and again by calling them  -->
